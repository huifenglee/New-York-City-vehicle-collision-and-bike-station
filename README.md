# Data Analytics Project using New York City Vehicle Collision and Bike Station Datasets

## 1. Introduction

Using the two datasets, I aim to answer the following questions:

- What is the most dangerous NYC borough / area for a bicycle rider? Use visualization.
- What would you change in the locations of bike stations to increase safety? Use visualization.
- Where can an accident occur and how close is this from the nearest bike station? Create a predictive 
model.
- Extra questions: What other interesting patterns do you find in the data? What other data sources 
would be interesting to correlate?

In the notebook ("New York Bike Station EDA and Predictive Modelling.ipynb"), those four questions are answered in Section 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively
The summary of answers has been written in the document "Results.docx" stored in the repository.


## 2. Versions of Python and Packages

- Python = Python 3.7.11
- Pandas = '1.3.4'
- Numpy = '1.21.5'
- Plotly = '5.8.0'
- sklearn = '1.0.2'

## 3.How to run the Notebook

If you have installed all the packages required for this notebook, you should be able to automatically run the script in Python without any additinal requirement. I have run the notebook in Visual Studio Code.
Please click this link in order to show the plotly graphs for this notebook (https://nbviewer.org/github/huifenglee/New-York-City-vehicle-collision-and-bike-station-EDA-and-Predictive-Modelling/blob/main/New%20York%20Bike%20Station%20EDA%20and%20Predictive%20Modelling.ipynb)
Github has some issue of rendering the graphs in the notebook.
